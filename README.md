2. Is MRSA diagnosed more often in patients with skin infections or patients who have undergone surgical procedures among hospitalized patients in the state of Washington?
3. Are incidents of Eczema and MRSA co-occurrence more frequent in hospitalized children (0-3 yrs.) compared to hospitalized older patients (above 60 years), in the state of Washington?
